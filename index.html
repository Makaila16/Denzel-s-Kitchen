    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p> I discovered my love for baking at the tender age of 10 when I baked my first batch of chocolate chip cookies with my grandmother. The joy of creating something delicous from scartch enthralled me. </p>
    <p> Over the years, I honed my skills by experimenting with various recipes even creating some of my own. My dream is to share the joy of baking with others and to inspire them to create their own baking wonders. </p>
